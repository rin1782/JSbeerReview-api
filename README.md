# README

This is an app to leave a review/comment on a listed beer.

The frontend was created using JavaScript and connects to a backend Rails API.

Upon loading the document, a user will see a list of preset beers. 
    **Eventually I would like to add a function to add beers to the list. 

A user will then click on a beer to be able to leave a comment/review on the beer's show page.

The beer's show page also includes a home button to return to the original list of beers. 

TO RUN:

this is run locally, so a user will load into their code base, and run "rails s" in the terminal.
This will connect it with your local host (localhost/3000)

Switch directory to front end of application (js)
